# PyBer_Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to provide a CEO of a ride share company a review of the ride shares across three different city types: urban, suburban, and rural cities. It also gives some recommendations on how to address these discrepancies in the future. 

### Tasks the analysis fulfilled
-	Provided a summary of each city's ride share data, which includes the fare and its price fluctuation over the course of 4 months, from January to May. 
-	An easy to view graph displaying these results. 

 
## Resources
-	Data Source: city_data.csv and ride_data.csv
-	Software: Python 3.8.1, Juypter Notebook, and Pandas

## Pyber Analysis Results
- The city types in the data were:
  - Urban
  - Suburban
  - Rural
- The analysis shows that within the recorded 4 month of data :
  - The total driver and total rides results were:
    - Urban cities had 1,625 rides and 2,405 drivers
    - Suburban cities had 625 rides and 490 drivers
    - Rural cities had 125 rides and 78 drivers
  -	The total fare amounts within the four-month period with the average fare per rider and driver were:
    - Urban cities totaled $39,854.38, with the average fare per ride being $24.53 and the average fare per driver being $16.57
    - Suburban cities totaled $19,356.33, with the average fare per ride being $30.97 and the average fare per driver being $39.50
    - Rural cities totaled $4,327.93, with the average fare per ride being $34.62 and the average fare per driver being $55.49
  -	Rural cites have the highest fare price on average for both per ride and per driver. 
  -	Only the urban cities had more drivers than rides available. Both the suburban and rural cities have more rides than drivers available. 
  - March saw a dip in the number of rides across all three cities, suburban cities seeing the lowest drop. Surprisingly, the urban cities never went back to the number of rides before the drop in March unlike the other two city types.

## Pyber Analysis Summary
- Based on these results, there is an obvious difference between the urban cities and the suburban and rural cities. Although there are more rides taken in urban cities than both suburban and rural cities combined, there are far more drivers in the urban cities, indicating there isn’t enough work in urban cities. Both suburban and rural cities have more rides than drivers, which is a good thing for the drivers but not for the customers who cannot get a ride due to the storage of drivers. The difference between the urban cities and the other types is that the drivers’ average fare is much less than the other two types, indicating that the urban city drivers are not making as much on average compared to drivers in the other city types. 
- One of the main recommendations I have to help even the discrepancies between the city types would be to create a marketing strategy to redirect urban drivers to the other city types. That way the supply is increased to meet the demand for the other two cities while still maintaining the demand in the urban cities. Another recommendation would be to potentially hold specials throughout the month of march to prevent the dip in sales
